## Spec-Driven Development

All work starts from a spec. Use a structured spec to guide implementation, review, and testing.

## Workflow

1. Draft spec and get approval
2. Implement in small, traceable commits
3. Update docs and AGENTS if needed
4. Validate against the spec before merge

## Plan Grouping

Specs are grouped by module using subdirectories:

```
docs/plans/
├── inventory/
├── sales/
├── finance/
└── ...
```

Add new module folders as needed and update the module list in docs/plans/AGENTS.md.
