# SDLC Testing Skill

Generate a complete **Testing & Quality** documentation suite for software development projects. This skill produces 5 documents that establish the testing baseline, define test cases, verify and validate the system, report results, and standardize peer reviews.

## When to Use

- Establishing a **testing strategy** for a SaaS project
- Writing **formal test plans** aligned with IEEE 829
- Creating **test case specifications** with traceability to requirements
- Planning **verification and validation** activities (V&V)
- Documenting **validation test results** for release decisions
- Standardizing **peer review and code inspection** processes
- Preparing for **phase gate reviews** that require test evidence

## When NOT to Use

- **Writing actual test code** (unit tests, integration tests) -- use `android-tdd` skill instead
- **Validating AI-generated code** -- use `ai-error-handling` skill (5-layer validation)
- **Planning security testing only** -- use `vibe-security-skill` for security patterns
- **Planning a single feature** -- use `feature-planning` skill (includes testing strategy)
- **Creating project plans** -- use `sdlc-planning` skill (SDP, QA Plan, SRS)
- **Designing architecture** -- use `sdlc-design` skill

## Document Inventory

| # | Document | File | Purpose | Audience | Phase |
|---|----------|------|---------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Software Test Plan | `templates/software-test-plan.md` | Testing strategy, tools, environments, schedule | QA leads, PMs, devs | After SRS + SDD |
| 2 | Test Case Specifications | `templates/test-case-specifications.md` | Detailed test steps, inputs, expected results | Test engineers, devs | During development |
| 3 | Validation & Verification Plan | `templates/validation-verification-plan.md` | V&V approach (built right + right product) | QA mgrs, PMs, compliance | After SRS + SDD |
| 4 | Validation Test Report | `templates/validation-test-report.md` | Test execution results and release decision | PMs, stakeholders, QA | Before release |
| 5 | Peer Review Report | `templates/peer-review-report.md` | Code, design, and document review findings | Dev team, tech leads | Throughout SDLC |

## Testing Philosophy

### TDD-First Development

All production code follows the **Red-Green-Refactor** cycle. Tests are written before implementation. Reference the `android-tdd` skill for the complete TDD workflow.

### Test Pyramid (70/20/10)

```
        /  UI/E2E  \       10% - Compose Testing, Espresso, browser E2E
       /------------\
      / Integration  \     20% - Room+MockWebServer, API with real DB
     /----------------\
    /   Unit Tests     \   70% - JUnit 5, MockK, PHPUnit (fast, isolated)
   /====================\
```

### Shift-Left Testing

Move testing activities as early as possible in the SDLC:

| Activity | Traditional Phase | Shift-Left Phase |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Unit testing | After coding | During coding (TDD) |
| Security testing | Pre-release | During design + development |
| Performance testing | Pre-release | During development (benchmarks) |
| Code review | After feature complete | Per-commit (PR-based) |
| Requirements review | After SRS finalized | During requirements gathering |

## Generation Workflow

Generate documents in this order. Each builds on the previous.

```
Prerequisite: SRS from sdlc-planning + SDD from sdlc-design
    |
Step 1: Software Test Plan (overall strategy)
    |
Step 2: Validation & Verification Plan (V&V approach)
    |
Step 3: Test Case Specifications (detailed test cases)
    |
    [--- Development & testing execution happens here ---]
    |
Step 4: Peer Review Reports (during development)
    |
Step 5: Validation Test Report (before release)
```

### Prerequisites

| Input | Source | Required? |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Software Requirements Spec (SRS) | `sdlc-planning` output | Yes |
| Software Design Document (SDD) | `sdlc-design` output | Recommended |
| Quality Assurance Plan | `sdlc-planning` output | Recommended |
| Risk Management Plan | `sdlc-planning` output | Recommended |
| Feature specifications | `feature-planning` output | If feature-level |

## Testing Layers Overview

### Integration Testing

| Platform | Framework | Scope |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Android | Room in-memory DB + MockWebServer | DAO queries, API contracts, auth flows |

## Adaptation Rules

### SaaS vs Standalone

| Aspect | Multi-Tenant SaaS | Standalone App |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Tenant isolation tests | Required (franchise_id in every query) | Not applicable |
| RBAC test cases | Full matrix (super_admin, owner, staff) | Simple role tests |
| Cross-tenant security | Dedicated test suite | Omit |
| Test data setup | Per-tenant fixtures (franchise_id = 1, 2) | Single dataset |

### Android + Web vs Web-Only

| Aspect | Android + Web | Web-Only |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Test frameworks | JUnit 5, MockK, Compose Testing + PHPUnit | PHPUnit only |
| UI testing | Compose tests + browser tests | Browser tests only |
| Offline testing | Room caching, network error scenarios | N/A |
| Device matrix | API levels 26-35, multiple screen sizes | Browser matrix |

### CI/CD Integration

| Stage | Trigger | Tests Run |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Pre-commit | Local commit | Unit tests (fast) |
| PR validation | PR created/updated | Unit + integration tests |
| Merge to develop | PR merged | Full test suite + coverage |
| Release candidate | Tag created | Full suite + security + performance |
| Post-deploy | Production deploy | Smoke tests only |

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] All 5 documents generated (or justified why one was skipped)
- [ ] Each document stays under 500 lines
- [ ] Test Plan references SRS requirement IDs for traceability
- [ ] Test cases use naming convention TC-[MODULE]-[TYPE]-[###]
- [ ] V&V Plan covers both verification (built right) and validation (right product)
- [ ] Test Report includes pass rates, coverage, and Go/No-Go recommendation
- [ ] Peer Review Report includes tech-stack-specific checklists
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation addressed in test cases and V&V plan
- [ ] Test environments match deployment environments (Windows/Ubuntu/Debian)
- [ ] Security test cases reference `vibe-security-skill` OWASP mapping
- [ ] Performance benchmarks have numeric targets (not vague language)
- [ ] Test data strategy handles franchise_id isolation
- [ ] Documents cross-reference each other and upstream SRS/SDD

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Do This Instead |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| No formal test plan | Ad-hoc testing misses critical paths | Write STP before testing begins |
| Test cases without expected results | Can't determine pass/fail | Every TC has explicit expected results |
| No traceability to requirements | Can't prove coverage | Map every TC to FR-xxx or NFR-xxx |
| Testing only happy paths | Edge cases cause production failures | Include negative, boundary, and error cases |
| No test data strategy | Inconsistent, flaky tests | Define fixtures, factories, seed data |
| Skipping security testing | Vulnerabilities ship to production | Include security test suite in every release |
| No peer review process | Bugs caught late, inconsistent code | Standardize reviews with checklists |
| Rubber-stamp reviews | Reviews provide no value | Require findings documented, metrics tracked |
| Testing in production only | Users find bugs, not testers | Test in staging first, smoke test prod |
