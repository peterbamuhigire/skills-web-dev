## Required Plugins

**Superpowers plugin:** MUST be active for all work using this skill. Use throughout the entire build pipeline — design decisions, code generation, debugging, quality checks, and any task where it offers enhanced capabilities. If superpowers provides a better way to accomplish something, prefer it over the default approach.

# SDLC User & Deployment Skill

Generate a complete **User & Deployment** documentation suite for software development projects. This skill produces 6 documents that guide end-users, system administrators, and operations teams through using, deploying, and maintaining the software.

## When to Use

- Preparing a SaaS product for **production deployment** and user onboarding
- Creating **end-user documentation** for franchise owners, staff, and members
- Writing **deployment and operations guides** for system administrators
- Developing **training programs** for new user onboarding
- Documenting **release notes** for version management and stakeholder communication
- Establishing **maintenance procedures** for ongoing system health
- Creating a **project README** for developer onboarding and project discovery

## When NOT to Use

- **Gathering raw requirements** -- use `project-requirements` skill
- **Project-level planning** (SDP, QA Plan, Risk Plan) -- use `sdlc-planning` skill
- **Designing architecture** (SDD, database design, API docs) -- use `sdlc-design` skill
- **Writing test plans and test cases** -- use `sdlc-testing` skill
- **Writing ERP module-specific manuals** with in-app PHP delivery -- use `manual-guide` skill
- **Planning a single feature** -- use `feature-planning` skill
- **Bootstrapping a new SaaS project** -- use `saas-seeder` skill
- **Updating project docs** (CLAUDE.md, README) after code changes -- use `update-claude-documentation`

## Document Inventory

| # | Document | File | Purpose | Audience | Phase |
|---|----------|------|---------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Software User Manual | `templates/software-user-manual.md` | End-user guide for using the software | End users, staff, franchise owners | Pre-launch |
| 2 | Operations / Deployment Manual | `templates/operations-deployment-manual.md` | Deploy, configure, and manage in production | SysAdmins, DevOps, IT ops | Pre-launch |
| 3 | Training Materials | `templates/training-materials.md` | Onboarding, tutorials, assessments | New users, trainers, HR | Pre-launch |
| 4 | Release Notes | `templates/release-notes.md` | Communicate changes per version | All stakeholders | Each release |
| 5 | Maintenance Manual | `templates/maintenance-manual.md` | Ongoing maintenance and troubleshooting | Support engineers, on-call, DevOps | Post-launch |
| 6 | README File | `templates/readme-file.md` | Project introduction for developers | Developers, contributors, evaluators | Project start |

## Audience Segmentation

| Audience | Role Examples | Documents |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| End Users | Franchise owners, staff, members, customers | User Manual, Training Materials |
| System Administrators | DevOps, IT ops, hosting team | Operations Manual, Maintenance Manual |
| Developers / Technical Team | Backend devs, mobile devs, contributors | README, Release Notes |
| Stakeholders / Management | Investors, product owners, project managers | Release Notes (simplified view) |

## Generation Workflow

Generate documents in this order. Each builds on the previous.

```
Prerequisite: SRS (sdlc-planning) + SDD (sdlc-design) + Test Reports (sdlc-testing)
    |
Step 1: README File (project baseline, developer onboarding)
    |
Step 2: Operations / Deployment Manual (how to set up and run)
    |
Step 3: Software User Manual (how to use the software)
    |
Step 4: Training Materials (how to teach users)
    |
Step 5: Maintenance Manual (how to keep it running)
    |
Step 6: Release Notes (per-version communication — ongoing)
```

**Rationale:** README establishes the project context. Operations manual documents deployment before users arrive. User manual describes the working system. Training materials build on the user manual. Maintenance manual handles post-launch operations. Release notes are ongoing with each version.

### Prerequisites

| Input | Source | Required? |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Software Requirements Spec (SRS) | `sdlc-planning` output | Yes |
| System Design Document (SDD) | `sdlc-design` output | Recommended |
| Validation Test Report | `sdlc-testing` output | Recommended |
| Working software (deployed to staging) | Development team | Yes (for user manual) |
| Deployment environment details | Infrastructure team | Yes (for ops manual) |
| Module/feature inventory | SRS or SDD | Yes |

## Writing Style Guidelines

### End-User Documents (User Manual, Training Materials)

- **Plain language** -- no jargon, no acronyms without definition
- **Active voice, present tense** -- "Click Save" not "The Save button should be clicked"
- **Step-by-step** -- numbered instructions with one action per step
- **Screenshot placeholders** -- format: `[Screenshot: {description} -- {screen-name}.png]`
- **Bold for UI elements** -- **Save**, **Dashboard**, **Reports** tab
- **Task-oriented** -- organize by what users want to do, not by features

### Admin Documents (Operations Manual, Maintenance Manual)

- **Technical but clear** -- assume Linux/server knowledge, explain project-specific details
- **Command examples** -- copy-pasteable with expected output
- **Troubleshooting trees** -- symptom to cause to solution
- **Checklists** -- pre-deployment, post-deployment, routine maintenance

### Developer Documents (README, Release Notes)

- **Concise** -- developers scan, they do not read prose
- **Code-focused** -- commands, configuration snippets, architecture diagrams
- **Architecture-aware** -- explain the "why" behind design decisions
- **Copy-pasteable** -- every command should work when pasted

## Multi-Tenant Considerations

- User manuals may need **tenant-specific branding** (logo, product name, colors)
- Training materials should use **generic tenant examples** (Tenant A, Tenant B)
- Operations manual must cover **tenant creation, suspension, and data isolation**
- Release notes go to **all tenants** -- avoid tenant-specific references
- Maintenance manual must include **cross-tenant data leakage** as a P1 incident

## Localization Considerations

- **Primary language:** English
- **Secondary languages:** Swahili (East Africa), French (West Africa)
- Use **simple sentence structures** that translate well
- Avoid idioms, cultural references, and humor
- Use **ISO date format** (YYYY-MM-DD) throughout
- Number formatting: consider local conventions (1,000.00 vs 1.000,00)
- **Screenshot text:** plan for screenshots in each language or use annotated callouts

## Output Structure

When generating documents for a project, create this structure:

```
docs/user-deploy/
├── 01-readme.md
├── 02-operations-deployment-manual.md
├── 02-operations/
│   ├── installation-guide.md
│   ├── configuration-reference.md
│   └── backup-recovery.md
├── 03-software-user-manual.md
├── 03-user-manual/
│   ├── getting-started.md
│   ├── module-guides.md
│   └── troubleshooting.md
├── 04-training-materials.md
├── 04-training/
│   ├── quick-start-guides.md
│   ├── tutorial-modules.md
│   └── assessments.md
├── 05-maintenance-manual.md
├── 05-maintenance/
│   ├── troubleshooting-guide.md
│   ├── runbooks.md
│   └── incident-management.md
└── 06-release-notes/
    ├── v1.0.0.md
    ├── v1.1.0.md
    └── changelog.md
```

Each file must stay under 500 lines. Split into subdirectories as needed.

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Do This Instead |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Skip user manual, ship anyway | Users flood support with basic questions | Write user manual before launch |
| No deployment documentation | Only one person knows how to deploy | Document every deployment step |
| Training = reading the manual | Adults learn by doing, not reading | Include hands-on exercises and labs |
| Vague release notes ("various fixes") | Users do not know what changed or why | Describe each change with context |
| No maintenance runbooks | Tribal knowledge; outages last longer | Write step-by-step runbooks |
| README with no setup instructions | New developers cannot get started | Include complete dev setup guide |
| One-size-fits-all training | Admins and end-users have different needs | Role-specific training paths |
| Outdated screenshots in manual | Users lose trust in documentation | Update screenshots with each release |
| No rollback procedures | Failed deployments become crises | Document rollback for every deployment |
