## 📋 Two-Phase Planning Process

### Phase 1: Specification (Requirements)

Create structured specifications that define **WHAT** to build.

### Phase 2: Implementation Planning (How)

Create detailed implementation plans that define **HOW** to build it.

---

## 🎯 Phase 1: Specification (Spec-Driven Development)

### When to Use Specification Phase

Activate when the user says:

- "Plan a feature"
- "Write a spec"
- "New module: [name]"
- "Create requirements for [feature]"

### Specification Process

1. **Analyze Context**: Review existing codebase to understand where the feature fits
2. **Ask Clarifying Questions**: Gather business logic, edge cases, and constraints (3-5 questions)
3. **Generate Specification**: Use structured template with user stories, acceptance criteria, and technical details

### Clarifying Questions (Pick 3-5)

1. **Business Domain**: Which primary module does this belong to (sales, inventory, finance, HR, assets)?
2. **Edge Cases**: What critical edge cases or failure modes must be handled?
3. **Data Model**: Which tables/fields are involved (especially tenant isolation)?
4. **Workflow/UI**: What exact UI flow and user actions are expected?
5. **Compliance/Reporting**: Any audit, reporting, or approval requirements?
6. **GIS/Mapping**: Will this feature require maps or geofencing? If yes, add `osm_api_key` to system settings and document it.

### Specification Template Structure

```markdown
# {Feature Title} — Spec

**Status:** Draft | Approved | Implemented
**Priority:** High | Medium | Low
**Domain:** {sales|inventory|finance|hr|assets}
**Estimated Effort:** {S|M|L|XL}

## User Story

As a **{role}**, I want to **{action}** so that **{value}**.

## Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

- [ ] {AC1: Functional requirement}
- [ ] {AC2: Edge case handling}
- [ ] {AC3: Validation rule}
- [ ] {AC4: Integration requirement}

## Technical Constraints

- {Constraint 1: Architecture decision}
- {Constraint 2: Performance requirement}
- {Constraint 3: Security consideration}

## Data Model

- **Tables:** {list affected tables}
- **Columns:** {table.column — type — purpose}
- **Relationships:** {foreign keys, constraints}
- **Indexes:** {performance optimization needs}

## High-Level Execution Plan

1. {Task 1} — `path/to/file.ext`
2. {Task 2} — `path/to/file.ext`
3. {Task 3} — `path/to/file.ext`

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** {what to test}
- **Integration Tests:** {cross-component testing}
- **Edge Cases:** {specific scenarios to cover}

## Rollout Strategy

- **Deployment:** {how to deploy safely}
- **Rollback:** {how to revert if needed}
- **Monitoring:** {what to monitor post-deployment}
```

### Specification Storage

**Location:** `docs/plans/specs/[domain]/[feature-name].md`

**Example:**

```
docs/plans/specs/sales/
├── user-profile-update.md
├── bulk-order-processing.md
└── commission-calculations.md

docs/plans/specs/inventory/
├── stock-adjustment-workflow.md
└── batch-expiry-alerts.md
```

---

## 🔧 Phase 2: Implementation Planning (TDD Workflow)

### When to Use Implementation Planning Phase

Activate when:

- Specification is approved and ready for implementation
- User says "implement [feature]" or "create plan for [feature]"
- Breaking down approved specs into executable tasks

### Implementation Planning Process

1. **Review Specification**: Understand requirements and constraints
2. **Decompose into Tasks**: Break into 2-5 minute bite-sized steps
3. **Apply TDD Workflow**: Test-first development with exact file paths
4. **Generate Complete Code**: Include full implementations, not placeholders
5. **Plan Testing Strategy**: Ensure all changes can be tested

### Bite-Sized Task Granularity

Break each feature into one-action steps (2-5 minutes):

- Write failing test → step
- Run to verify failure → step
- Implement minimal code → step
- Run to verify pass → step
- Commit → step

### Implementation Plan Structure

**Index File:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-[feature-name].md`
**Section Files:** `docs/plans/[feature-name]/` (for complex features)

**📖 IMPORTANT:** Use **Prompting Patterns** and **Orchestration** for better plans:

**Prompting Patterns** (`references/prompting-patterns.md`):
- Clear Task + Context + Constraints (every task)
- Chain-of-Thought for complex logic
- Few-Shot Learning for code examples
- Structured Output for tests
- Constraints for scope control

**Orchestration** (`references/orchestration-patterns.md`):
- Sequential for dependent tasks (database → model → controller)
- Parallel for independent tasks (API + UI simultaneously - 30% faster)
- Conditional for different paths (if external API vs if CSV import)
- Looping for repeated processes (multi-module setup)
- Retry for unreliable operations (external APIs)

Apply these patterns to make plans AI-agent executable with minimal clarification and optimal execution.

```

### Task Structure Template

**💡 Use Prompting Patterns:** Every task should include TASK + CONTEXT + CONSTRAINTS. See `references/prompting-patterns.md` for examples.

````markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**FILE:** `exact/path/to/file.py`

**TASK:** [Specific action to perform - clear and unambiguous]

**CONTEXT:** [Why this is needed - business/technical reason]

**CONSTRAINTS:**
- [Technical constraint 1]
- [Limit/requirement 2]
- [Standard/convention 3]

**THINK STEP-BY-STEP:** (for complex tasks)
1. [Step 1] - [Reasoning]
2. [Step 2] - [Reasoning]
3. [Final approach]

**CODE:**
```python
def function_name(input: Type) -> ReturnType:
    """Clear docstring."""
    # Complete, runnable implementation
    return result
```

**VALIDATION:**
- [ ] Test passes
- [ ] Follows project conventions
- [ ] Handles edge cases
````

**Step 2: Run test to verify failure**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

**Step 4: Run test to verify pass**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```

## 📱 Android SaaS App — Mandatory Phase 1 Bootstrap

**TRIGGER:** When planning features for a **new** native Android app that connects to an existing SaaS backend.

**RULE:** The first implementation plan MUST be **Phase 1: Login + Dashboard + Empty Tabs**. No business features are planned until Phase 1 is fully implemented, tested, and verified E2E.

### Phase 1 Scope

| Component | What It Delivers |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Authentication** | JWT login/logout, token refresh with rotation, breach detection, encrypted token storage |
| **Dashboard** | Real KPI stats from backend, offline-first Room caching, pull-to-refresh, shimmer loading |
| **Navigation** | Bottom bar with max 5 major section tabs, placeholder "Coming Soon" screens |
| **Infrastructure** | Hilt DI, Retrofit interceptor chain, Room DB, Material 3 theme, network monitor |
| **Backend** | Mobile JWT endpoints + dual auth middleware (JWT for mobile, session for web) |
| **Tests** | 40+ unit tests across all layers (ViewModels, Use Cases, Repos, Interceptors) |

### Why This Order

- Proves the full vertical slice works end-to-end before investing in features
- Establishes all infrastructure patterns every future feature reuses
- Gives the user a working installable app on day one
- Uncovers integration issues (auth, env loading, session handling) before they compound

### Phase 1 Plan Structure (11 Sections)

```
docs/plans/phase-1-login-dashboard/
├── 00-build-variants.md
├── 01-project-bootstrap.md
├── 02-backend-api.md
├── 03-core-infrastructure.md
├── 04-authentication-feature.md
├── 05-dashboard-feature.md
├── 06-navigation-tabs.md
├── 07-room-database.md
├── 08-theme-ui-components.md
├── 09-testing.md
└── 10-verification.md
```

### Tab Limit Rule

Bottom navigation tabs are limited to **5 maximum**. Group related features under tabs:

- **Good:** Home, Sales, Network, Knowledge, Training (5 tabs)
- **Bad:** Home, Sales, Invoices, Network, Clients, Products, Reports (7 tabs - too many)

If more than 5 sections exist, nest sub-sections within tabs or use drawer navigation.

### Phase 2+ Trigger

Only plan Phase 2 after Phase 1 is:
- Built successfully (`./gradlew assembleDevDebug`)
- All tests passing (`./gradlew testDevDebugUnitTest`)
- All backend endpoints verified via curl (login, refresh, dashboard, logout)
- Breach detection verified (revoked token replay returns 401)

See `android-saas-planning` skill for the complete Phase 1 template.

## 🏗️ Architectural Decision Framework

**CRITICAL**: Before creating any implementation plan, evaluate whether to use **static skills** vs **dynamic sub-agents** based on the decision matrix below. This choice significantly impacts token efficiency, development velocity, and maintenance costs.

### Skills vs Sub-Agents Decision Matrix

| Factor              | Use **Static Skills**            | Use **Dynamic Sub-Agents**       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Token Usage**     | Low (pre-loaded)                 | Variable (loaded on demand)      |
| **Execution Speed** | Fast (always ready)              | Slower (initialization overhead) |
| **Customization**   | Limited (static code)            | High (dynamic, configurable)     |
| **Maintenance**     | Low (infrequent updates)         | Higher (frequent iterations)     |
| **Scalability**     | Limited (VS Code extension size) | High (unlimited agents)          |
| **Complexity**      | Low (simple patterns)            | High (orchestration needed)      |
| **Collaboration**   | Easy (shared codebase)           | Complex (distributed agents)     |

### When to Use Static Skills
✅ **Perfect for:**
- **Common operations** (file editing, terminal commands, searches)
- **Stable functionality** (rarely changing requirements)
- **Performance-critical** tasks (must be fast)
- **Simple workflows** (linear, predictable)
- **Team collaboration** (shared understanding)
- **Documentation tasks** (consistent formatting)

### When to Use Dynamic Sub-Agents
✅ **Perfect for:**
- **Complex business logic** (custom algorithms, ML models)
- **Evolving requirements** (frequent changes needed)
- **Specialized domains** (industry-specific knowledge)
- **Scalable systems** (many similar but different agents)
- **Experimental features** (A/B testing, rapid prototyping)
- **Third-party integrations** (APIs, databases, external services)
- **Heavy computations** (data processing, analysis)

### Token Cost Analysis
**Static Skills:** Low initial cost, very low per-use cost
**Dynamic Sub-Agents:** Low initial cost, medium per-use cost

### Plan Enhancement Requirements
**For Static Skills Plans:** Focus on performance optimization
**For Dynamic Sub-Agents Plans:** Include configuration management and monitoring

**Required in Every Plan:**
- **Architecture Declaration**: State approach and justification
- **Token Cost Analysis**: Include estimated usage and break-even analysis
- **Skill References**: Link to relevant skills in `skills/` directory
- **Migration Path**: If converting approaches, include migration steps

---

## 📋 Plan Document Header

Start every plan with this header:

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

**Specification:** [Link to spec if exists]

---
````

---

## ✅ Plan Essentials

Include in every plan:

- **Architecture Declaration**: State whether using skills or sub-agents and provide justification based on the decision matrix
- **Token Cost Analysis**: Include estimated token usage, break-even analysis, and performance implications
- **Skill References**: Link to relevant skills in `skills/` directory and explain why they apply
- **Exact file paths** - Never "add validation to the file"
- **Complete code** - Full implementations, not placeholders
- **Exact commands** - With expected output
- **Testability** - Ensure all changes can be tested later (add hooks, APIs, fixtures, or logs where needed)
- **PHP syntax check** - For any PHP files touched, include a `php -l <file>` step after changes
- **Schema adherence** - Verify all SQL aligns to `database/schema/*.sql` and update schema files, procedures, and triggers as needed
- **Cross-layer completeness** - Explicitly cover database, stored procedures, triggers, UI, APIs, services, middleware, and any other impacted layers
- **Verification steps** - Add concrete checks that confirm schema alignment and functional correctness
- **Multi-file plans** - If the plan is large, split into multiple markdown files and provide an index file that links to each section
- **Status tracking** - Include a status section (not-started/in-progress/completed) per task and keep it updated during implementation
- **Self-updating plans** - If implementation decisions change or new optional steps are discovered, update the plan files immediately so progress is always current

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

**DO:**

- Start with specification phase for new features
- Break implementation into 2-5 minute tasks
- Include complete code samples
- Specify exact paths and line numbers
- Follow DRY, YAGNI principles
- Test-driven development
- Commit after each green test

**DON'T:**

- Create huge monolithic tasks
- Use pseudocode or placeholders
- Skip test verification steps
- Assume context exists
- Make untested changes
- Leave PHP changes without a `php -l` syntax check


## Domain-Specific Mandatory Requirements

### POS & Sales Systems (CRITICAL for Audit Compliance)

When planning features for POS, checkout, or sales entry systems, **ALWAYS** include **M1: POS Session Locking** and **M2: Sequential Receipt Control & Gap Detection**. These are non-negotiable audit compliance requirements.

**Full details:** See [POS Mandatory Requirements](references/pos-mandatory-requirements.md)

**Planning Trigger:** Activates for "POS system", "Point of Sale", "sales entry", "checkout system", "cashier interface", "invoice recording", "receipt management".
